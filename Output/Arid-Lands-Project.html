<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>One distinct characteristic of arid regions is the inadequacy of
water or moisture, which may result from biological factors such as the
nature of soil or climatic factors such as inadequate precipitation and
high evaporation rate. Over the years, the world population has been
increasing, and as such population in arid regions has seen a
significant increase. Growing populations result in a greater need for
water for both residential and commercial purposes. (Hanasaki et al.,
2013). Water conservation is the efficient use and management of water
resources to meet the needs of the current generation and that of the
future generation. In essence, water conservation prevents water from
getting wasted (Malekian Jabali et al., 2017). Water conservation
techniques may be traditional or non-traditional. Non-traditional water
conservation techniques are those techniques that are not developed from
the people’s culture. Cloud seeding, fog catching, desalination, and
iceberg catching are non-traditional water conservation methods. With
few studies focusing on the effectiveness of traditional water
conservation techniques, this study thus examines the various
traditional methods used to conserve water in the dry regions of
northern Africa and their effectiveness.</p>
</div>
<div id="study-area" class="section level3">
<h3>STUDY AREA</h3>
<p>The boundaries of this region have been the subject of multiple
debates. The North Africa region stretches from the western Atlantic
shores of Morocco through Algeria and Libya to the Suez Canal in Egypt
and the Red Sea (Abun-Nasr, 2023). From this definition, Libya, Egypt,
Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia make the countries of North Africa. This
region’s arid nature is one of its unique features. The infamous Sahara
Desert spans throughout this region. The region has semi-arid and arid
climates with scorching summers and cold winters with little rain
throughout the year (N. I. Council, 2009). Along the coasts of Morocco,
Algeria, Tunisia, and parts of Libya and Egypt, the climate is that of
the Mediterranean. (N. I. Council, 2009). In addition to the Middle
East, North Africa is the world’s most water-scarce region, receiving
only two percent of the world’s renewable freshwater. Furthermore, the
region’s growing population and poor water management are expected to
make the shortage of water worse (Dargham, 2019). The conditions that
exist in this region require effective water management and
practices.</p>

<h3>TRADITIONAL WATER CONSERVATION TECHNIQUES</h3>
<p>People typically reside near oases and rivers in the desert, and they
adopt customary practices to preserve water for usage in household,
agricultural, and industrial settings. Most people in Morocco depend on
the traditional Khettara water systems because they live close to oases.
(Adeel, 2008).</p>
</div>
<div id="khettaras-foggaras" class="section level3">
<h3>KHETTARAS / FOGGARAS</h3>
<p>For years, water scarcity has been an issue for the residents of the
desert areas of Morocco. To solve the issue of water scarcity, residents
have adapted to a local water system of conservation known as Khettaras.
Khettaras are ancient water systems where residents first identify a
groundwater source and then build a series of wells from the water
source to their farmlands. A network of subterranean tunnels is then
constructed to connect these wells to their farmlands. The tunnels are
built in such a way that they permit water to flow through them. The
purpose of the wells is to allow air circulation and to provide access
for workers to enter the tunnel during maintenance (Fitzwilliam-Hall,
2009).</p>
<p>In general, Khettaras collect the uppermost portion of the water
table and use gravity to distribute the water to farmlands. (Idda et
al., 2021). Khettaras are known as Foggaras in Algeria.</p>
<p>This water system is a highly developed, old water technique that has
been used for irrigation for thousands of years. (Peroni, 2015). The
construction of Khettaras is more like communal labor. Each family
participates in the construction process and thus the water rights
belong to everyone who participates in the construction process. It is a
communal system that is typically owned by the entire community rather
than by a single individual or family. (Fitzwilliam-Hall, 2009). Just
like Khettaras, the Foggaras in Algeria are owned by the people who
engaged in the construction of the system and their descendants (Idda et
al., 2021).</p>
<p>Figure 1 is the schematic diagram of a Khettara. The part labeled 4
is the air shaft which is designed to allow air to pass through the
system. During maintenance, the air shaft serves as an opening for
workers to enter the system. The intervals between one shaft and the
other are labeled as 7. Part 9 is the water table and 6 is the farmlands
or the irrigation land. The inclined nature of the Khettara water system
is to allow water to flow towards the irrigation dam.</p>

<p>Khettaras has been a beneficial and sustainable method of acquiring
water and conserving it in the desert areas of Morocco and Algeria in
the case of Foggaras. But they have been deserted and allowed to
deteriorate (El Faiz &amp; Ruf, 2010). Among the numerous reasons for
the water system’s abandonment is the reduction in the importance of
agriculture to the economy and the installation of hand pumps in the
1970s which caused over-pumping and consequently decreased water levels,
ultimately causing the majority of the Khettaras to dry up. (Peroni,
2015). The establishment of the nationwide irrigation dams is also a
reason for the reduction in water levels as they prevented the
downstream recharge of aquifers (Fitzwilliam-Hall, 2009). Both the
construction and maintenance of Khettaras are labor intensive and
considering the reduction in the amount of flow, resulting from
over-pumping, most communities have given up on the Khettara water
systems (Fitzwilliam-Hall, 2009). While researchers and organized
community farmers interested in cultural preservation blame
over-pumping, engineers who think modern technology is flawless often
point the finger at prolonged droughts as the primary cause of the
declining water table. (Faiz &amp; Ruf, 2009).</p>

class="uri">https://www.agrimaroc.ma/khettaras-irrigation-ancestraux-errachidia/</a></em></p>
<p>Whether it was the drought or over-pumping, one major reason that led
to the decline of the Khattera water system was institutional management
(Faiz &amp; Ruf, 2009). The management of the Khattera is governed by
customary law and it is the duty of the traditional water organization
which is composed of water users to supervise and manage the various
Khattera systems in each community. In addition, local associations that
are established to prepare development plans and projects for Khattera
communities also play a management role (Adeel, 2008). Therefore, it is
without a doubt that the management of the Khattera water system
requires strong leadership and communal participation. However, the
reduction in the water levels in most Khatteras has reduced the
motivation of community members and a reduction in the activeness of
associations and organizations.</p>
<p>In the few places in southern Morocco where there is the motivation
to manage Khatteras, organizations, and associations are faced with
issues of inadequate funding (Adeel, 2008). To battle the issue of the
dying Khattera systems, the Moroccan government has established a
recovery plan to revive the various Khatteras in the country to deal
with the issue of water scarcity in the region. Over the years,
Non-governmental organizations have also come in with their support
(Peroni, 2015).</p>
<p>Khatteras have proven to be useful, but because the level of the
water table is dependent on precipitation, insufficient precipitation in
this region creates a disadvantage for the Khettera water system, which
has resulted in the abandonment of many Khettaras in many Moroccan
villages. In addition to this disadvantage, Khatteras are easily
destroyed in the event of an earthquake. Its great demand for labor has
also proven to be a downside. Without a doubt, the most significant
limitation of Khattaras is that it is labor intensive in both
construction and maintenance. (Beaumont et al., 1989; Fitzwilliam-Hall,
2009).</p>
<p>However, despite the downsides, Khatteras have proven to be very
sustainable in the sense that the system provides a source of water
without depleting the underground water resources as compared to water
pumps. Since Khatteras are made to collect water from the top of the
water table, they can collect the amount of water that is naturally
present. (Fitzwilliam-Hall, 2009). The construction and maintenance may
be very labor intensive; however, the extraction of the water requires
no human, animal, or mechanical efforts but gravity alone. For this
reason, no extra cost is required for the extraction. In a developing
economy with unstable electricity, this method of water conservation is
very effective.</p>

<div id="jessour" class="section level3">
<h3>JESSOUR</h3>
<p>Tunisia’s environment is characterized by arid and semi-arid
climates, water scarcity, and significant irregularity in water
resources. It is therefore not surprising that a series of severe
droughts have led to cuts in water supply (N. R. Council, 2007). Despite
its scarce water resources, the country is characterized by torrential
rainfall. For this reason, most traditional methods of water
conservation are based on rainwater harvesting and storage.</p>
<p>Jessour is a traditional method of water harvesting and conservation
whereby locally made earthen dykes or dams known as “tibia” are
constructed along valley floors to block runoff water (Gasmi et al.,
2021). In valleys, a series of dams are built to slow down runoff and
retain water for agricultural purposes. The system is built to store the
highest amount of water possible after every rainfall. It is estimated
that Jessour can supply water for a hydrologic year after one torrential
rainfall (Abdelli et al., 2017). The structure consists of three
components: the Dam, Terrace, and the Catchment area (also known as an
Impluvium). The dam, also known as “Tibia” is a locally made dyke
usually 2 to 5 meters high with a spillway channel. The spillway
channels are usually made of stones. The cropping area is the Terrace
and the Impluvium is the reservoir (Bonvallot, 1992; Calianno et al.,
2020). Thus, the system begins with the dam and ends with the catchment
area.</p>

<p>In Figure 3, the parts labeled (a) and (b) show the general view of a
typical Jessour water system. (c) is a picture of a terrace and (d) is a
catchment area.</p>
<p>Due to the erosive nature of the rainfall, these dykes also help to
trap silt from upstream. The dykes are made up of mud and are sometimes
reinforced with stones and wood. The frequent deposition of silt and
sediment in the system requires that its height be raised after every
rainfall. To prevent the system from being damaged, excess water is
discharged through an opening reinforced with dry stones (Terrace).
(Piras et al., 2022). The deposition of sand at the base of the system
provides fertile soil because these sands are filled with organic
matter. In addition, the retention of water in the system helps to
increase infiltration which helps with groundwater recharge.</p>
<p>Despite their importance, these systems are faced with several issues
which include the destruction of the system during torrential rainfalls
which leads to water spillage and then eventually water loss and
flooding. Also, in situations where the deposited sand or silts are made
up of clayey silts, infiltration rates tend to decrease, and groundwater
discharge decreases (Piras et al., 2022). Due to the exposure of the
system to wind and sunlight, evaporation tends to decrease the amount of
water in the system. Jessour is not the only form of traditional
rainwater harvesting in Tunisia, but it is one of the oldest methods of
rainwater harvesting in the form of runoff. Other methods of rainwater
harvesting in this region are usually in small quantities and more
domestic. The roof water harvesting technique which involves capturing
rainwater that falls from the roof into reservoirs and tanks is an
example of such a domestic method. The Jessour runoff harvesting system
for years has helped with the water scarcity issues in many Tunisian
communities.</p>

class="section level3">
<h3>TRADITIONAL WATER CONSERVATION METHODS VERSUS MODERN METHODS</h3>
<p>Modern methods of water conservation and traditional methods have
both proven to be very effective. Both methods have also proven to be
effective in situations where the other lags. Modern methods of water
conservation simply involve the use of modern technology in water
storage and management. There exist various modern methods of water
conservation and management, some of which are discussed below.</p>
<p>Desalination involves the treatment of salty seawater into usable
water, and it is an example of modern water conservation methods that
have proven to be very effective in arid climates. However, like many
other new technologies, the process of desalination, apart from being
expensive, also comes with some environmental costs. Carbon emissions
from desalination plants are one of the environmental costs that must be
considered in production. With regard to production cost, although
research has proven that the cost of desalination has been reducing
gradually since the 1960s, it is still an expensive method of water
conservation for most regions in the world when compared with other
methods (Zhou &amp; Tol, 2005). It must also be noted that not all arid
regions are close to the sea, and for that reason, desalination becomes
even more expensive in regions that are far from the sea, as the cost of
production includes transportation and transport parties.</p>
<p>Regarding proximity to sea, Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia have no
issues, since they line the Mediterranean Sea. Algeria has been using
the desalination method to reduce water stress in times of intense
droughts and it has proved effective (Belhassan, 2022). The Foggaras in
Algeria have been an efficient way of water conservation, but due to the
abandonment of most of the Foggaras, their importance has reduced.
Therefore, it is not surprising that the country has adopted a modern
method of conservation. Other rain-enhancing techniques such as cloud
seeding have so far helped solve the water scarcity issues in some dry
regions of the world (Sahu, 2019). Installation of water pumps for
domestic and commercial use as well as water sprinklers for irrigation
can all be considered modern water conservation techniques.</p>
<p>All methods of water conservation, whether traditional or modern,
have their unique merits and demerits. In as much as modern methods have
proven to be very effective; the cost of construction, reducing water
table levels and water quality, and health issues among others have been
a downside. Comparing traditional techniques to modern methods, it is
obvious that traditional methods are less effective than modern methods
of water conservation, however, traditional methods have shown to be
more sustainable than modern techniques. For example, the Khatteras in
Morocco and the Foggaras in Algeria have proven to be more sustainable
methods of tapping underground water resources than machine pumps. The
reason for this as stated in the previous headings is that the Khatteras
or Foggaras capture the underground water that is naturally available at
any given time. However, machine pumps can pump underground water
without limit, and this often leads to a decline in the water table
level which tends to affect surface water quantity and then have a
ripple effect on plant and animal life in arid climates.</p>
<p>Despite their downsides, modern methods of water conservation and
management have helped with solving the issues of food scarcity in arid
regions as they have increased irrigation. In Morocco and Tunisia,
desalination methods have been used to treat salty seawater for
irrigation during periods of drought (Belhassan, 2022). In other arid
climates, cloud seeding has been used to ensure all-year-round
agriculture production (Sahu, 2019).</p>

<h3>SUMMARY, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND CONCLUSION</h3>
<p>Water scarcity in arid regions comes with the need for effective
water conservation practices. In the arid regions of North Africa,
Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria from ancient times have adopted
traditional water conservation techniques to deal with the water
scarcity issues in the region. These methods of water conservation have
proven to be very effective in serving the needs of local communities
for both domestic and commercial purposes. Compared to modern methods,
these traditional methods of water conservation have proven to be more
sustainable and environmentally friendly. Traditional methods have also
demonstrated their ability to bring communities together. For example,
the Khettaras in Morocco and the Foggaras in Algeria apart from serving
their purpose of conserving water also enhanced community engagement
since the whole community shared ownership rights. In Tunisia, areas
that have the Jessour water system have experienced high agricultural
productivity due to the accumulation of sediments and fertile soil
behind the dikes (dams) of the system. This system is also capable of
supplying water for an entire farming year with as little one torrential
rainfall in a year.</p>
<p>These traditional methods of water conservation, despite their
importance, have shown weaknesses when compared to modern methods of
conserving water. Modern methods on the other hand, although very
effective, have also shown weaknesses in certain aspects. The three
countries in the study area, after abandoning most of their traditional
methods, have adopted modern methods of water conservation, yet are
still faced with issues of water scarcity especially in their rural
communities. To help solve the issue of water scarcity in this region,
this paper has identified the need to combine traditional water
conservation methods with that of the modern.</p>
<p>The combination of both methods of water conservation will not only
improve water availability in these regions but will also improve
domestic income and reduce poverty in rural communities in these
regions. This is because the combination of both methods will lead to an
inexpensive supply of water for farming communities, and as a result,
help to increase agriculture production. An increase in agriculture
production is expected to increase domestic income as well as reduce
unemployment in rural farming communities.</p>
<p>Combining both water conservation methods means that abandoned
traditional methods must be revived. These revitalization projects will
eventually come with a new set of costs and issues associated with
planning and policy-making. For example, the revitalization of the
Khettaras and Foggaras would mean that there is going to be a reduction
in the number of hand-pumps in various communities where revitalization
projects take place to help restore the groundwater table. In the short
run, reducing the number of hand pump machines might lead to minor water
issues, but in the long run, benefits would exceed that of the short
run. At the same time, there would be the need to build up old and
damaged Khettaras or Foggaras. This means that great funding is needed
for the redevelopment project.</p>
<p>As in the case of Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia, inadequate and lack
of funding has been the major issue hindering the revitalization of
these traditional water systems. To ensure the effective revitalization
of these water systems at a reduced cost, this paper suggests that the
governments in these countries collaborate with private organizations
and NGOs to implement the plan. Also, including traditional water
systems sites in eco-tourism would help with their regular maintenance
through revenue generation.</p>
<p>Since traditional methods of water conservation are embedded in the
culture and lifestyle of the people in these regions, a simple
revitalization alone is not enough to ensure the continued existence of
these systems. As stated by the Young Water Professionals Morocco,
knowledge about the traditional systems from ancient times has been
transmitted through oral teachings and folklore and as a result,
increased emigration has been a hindrance to knowledge transmission and
hence the abandonment of many traditional systems of water conservation
(YWP, 2023). To ensure the continued existence of the redevelopment
project, this paper would recommend that the governments in these areas
encourage the teaching of traditional water conservation methods in
schools and training centers to help sharpen the interests of the new
generation in supporting traditional water conservation methods. The
above recommendations, if implemented, will help reduce the water stress
in these regions, especially in their rural communities.</p>
