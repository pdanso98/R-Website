<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>One of the issues associated with the increasing population of humans
is their impact on biodiversity. As the human population increases,
their impacts and influence on biodiversity also increase. To reduce
human impacts on biodiversity, measures such as nature preserves have
been introduced to maintain and safeguard biodiversity and to provide a
sanctuary for species(NationalGeographic 2019). Over the years, many
have come up with ideas on how to set up various nature preserves, as
well as where to locate these preserves.</p>
<p>Among such proposals is the one introduced by Frank J. Popper and
Deborah Popper in a 1987 essay. The idea was to create an extensive
nature preserve by restoring 139,000 square miles (360,000 km²) of the
drier portion of the Great Plains to native prairie (Grassland
Ecosystem) and then reintroduce the American bison, also known as
Buffalo, that once grazed the short grass prairie. Their proposal was
termed the Buffalo Commons (Barbato 2021).</p>
<p>The main reason for their proposal was that, during that time, there
was a steady decline in the rural population because of the introduction
of mechanized agriculture. Hence, fewer people were needed to cultivate
the larger parts of the land. The region’s rural economy suffered
greatly due to periodic disasters such as the Dust Bowl, especially in
the drier parts. Thus, Frank J. Popper and Deborah Popper argued that
the area wasn’t sustainable for large-scale commercial farming
(Wikipedia 2024).</p>
<p>Thus, to shift a significant portion of the region away from
intensive farming and ranching practices and to address environmental
and economic challenges in the plains, where population declines and
unsustainable land use have been observed, they proposed the Buffalo
Commons. After its proposal, the Buffalo Commons did not receive as much
attention as it should have, however, as the years went by, it has
received the attention of policymakers, yet one problem remains. Finding
the best location for the Buffalo Commons has been a challenge to
policymakers, it is for this reason that this project is being
conducted.</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to find the best location for the
Buffalo Commons using five main variables which include, population
density, population change, farmland value, percent federal lands, and
counties adjacent to Indian reservations.</p>
</div>
<div id="methods" class="section level3">
<h3>METHODS</h3>
<p>As stated earlier, the five variables used in this project include
Population density, population change, farmland value, percent federal
lands, and counties adjacent to Indian reservations. Since the Buffalo
Commons is a nature preserve, it is best situated in an environment that
will have fewer human impacts, so assessing the population density of
the area before selection is important. In this project, suitability
ranks were assigned to population density. The ranks ranged from 1
through to 5, with the highest ranks being more suitable for locating
the Buffalo Commons. The highest ranks relate to counties with low
population density and vice versa.</p>
<p>In most cases, counties may have low population densities, however,
they may have a good potential to increase in the future which makes it
not suitable for locating buffalo commons. In this case, there is a need
to assess the population change for the various counties. To do this,
Suitability ranks were assigned to the population change attribute table
to determine the best counties for locating the Buffalo Commons.
Counties with a declining population are preferred to increasing
populations. The suitability ranks ranged from 1 through to 5, with 5
representing counties with the highest population decline.</p>
<p>Land Value was the third variable used to determine suitability.
Here, farmlands with low value or cost are preferred to high-value
farmlands due to budget restrictions. For this reason, farmlands with
the lowest value were assigned a high suitability rank of 5, while the
high-value farmlands were given low suitability ranks. The suitability
ranks range from 1 to 5.</p>
<p>Federal lands are lands that are owned by the government; thus, it is
easier to acquire those lands than those that are privately owned. For
this reason, the counties with the highest federal lands are preferred
and more suitable for the Buffalo Commons, and thus, they were assigned
the highest suitability rank. The suitability ranks ranged from 1
through to 5.</p>
<p>Lastly, counties that are adjacent to Indian reservations are
preferred to those that are not. The select by location tool was used to
select counties that are within 5 US Survey miles of Indian
reservations, and they were assigned a rank of 1 to indicate that they
are adjacent to Indian reservations. All the rest were assigned a rank
of 0 to indicate that they were not adjacent to Indian reservations.</p>

<h3>STUDY AREA</h3>
<p>With much of it covered in steppe, prairie, and grassland, the Great
Plains lies just to the east of the Rocky Mountains in the United States
(Fenneman 1917; Robinson 2023). It is bordered by the Rio Grande in the
south. It is a large expanse of flatland in North America (Robinson
2023). The Great Plains consists of Ten (10) states, which include,
Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Nebraska, Kansas,
Colorado, Oklahoma, Texas, and New Mexico. In total, there are about 824
counties in this region. Below is a map of the study area.</p>

<div class="figcaption"><strong><em>MAP1: STUDY AREA</em></strong></div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="population-density" class="section level3">
<h3>POPULATION DENSITY</h3>
<p>The number of people living in a particular area divided by the total
size of the area is termed population density. High population density
is an indication that there are more people concentrated in a particular
area. The goal of this project is to identify areas that have low
population density. Thus, a suitability rank was assigned to various
counties in this region ranging from 1 to 5, with the highest
suitability rank being 5. The highest rank of 5 was given to counties
with low population density. A rank of 1 was given to cities with high
population density, in this case, low suitability.</p>
<p>The method of classification used for this variable was Quantile. A
suitability rank of 5 was very highly suitable, 4 was highly suitable,
and 3 was moderate. Ranks 2 and 1 were low suitability and very low
suitability respectively.</p>
<p>On the population density map, the yellow color represents counties
with very low population density and thus was assigned a rank of 5. The
counties with red color had high population density and were thus
assigned a rank of 1. The color gradient ranges from yellow to red with
colors closer to yellow having low density and high suitability. The
colors close to red have high density and hence low suitability. The
orange color represents moderate suitability with moderate population
density.</p>
<p>Below is a table showing the population density classification.</p>

<p>From the map, most of the counties in the northern part of the Great
Plains have a higher suitability ranking than those in the southern
part. Montana, Wyoming, North, and South Dakota, and most of the western
part of Texas have low population density and high suitability rankings
in general. Below is the population density map.</p>

<h3>POPULATION CHANGE</h3>
<p>Population changes measure the extent to which the population of a
country increases or decreases over a particular period. Nature reserves
are thus best situated in areas with declining human populations than
those with increasing populations. The population change variable in
this project was used to identify the rate of increase or decrease in
the populations of counties in the Great Plains. Counties with
decreasing populations were assigned a high suitability ranking while
those with increasing populations were assigned a lower suitability
ranking. The suitability ranking ranged from 1 through to 5, with 5
being the highest suitability rank.</p>
<p>The Population change variable was classified using the manual
interval method with five classes. A suitability rank of 5 was very
highly suitable, 4 was highly suitable, and 3 was moderate. Ranks 2 and
1 were low suitability and very low suitability respectively.</p>
<p>On the population change map, the yellow color represents counties
with high decreasing populations and thus was assigned a rank of 5. The
counties with red color had a high increasing population and were thus
assigned a rank of 1. The color gradient ranges from yellow to red with
colors closer to yellow having low population change and high
suitability. The colors close to red have high population change and
hence low suitability. The orange color represents moderate suitability
with stable population change. Below is a table showing the
classification of population change and the population change map.</p>

<div id="farmland-value" class="section level3">
<h3>FARMLAND VALUE</h3>
<p>One of the most important aspects of this project is to purchase the
farmlands from the farm owners for the Buffalo Commons. With a limited
budget of 20 billion USD, coupled with the need to get the maximum
number of farmlands possible to establish the Buffalo Commons, there is
a need to select the farmlands that have the lowest value or cost. It
should be noted that the farmers need to be paid twice the price of the
farmland as a form of incentive. For this reason, we must look out for
farmlands whose value is equal to or a little bit less than 10 billion
USD. Counties with low farmland values and cost were assigned a high
suitability rank of 5, with those of high values and cost having a
suitability rank of 1. The suitability ranking ranged from 1 through to
5.</p>
<p>The method of classification used for this variable was the Quantile
classification method. Land values less than or equal to 236 were the
least with the highest suitability rankings. The highest value was
greater than 716 and it had the lowest suitability ranking of 1. High
suitability rankings are represented by the yellow color and the least
suitability ranking is shown with red. The color gradient ranges from
yellow through to red.</p>

<p>From the map, most of the counties in the western parts of the Great
Plain have low farmland values, this is represented by the yellow color.
Montana, Wyoming, and New Mexico are the states with the lowest land
values. Counties in eastern Texas have most of the counties with the
highest land values, which are represented in red color. Below is a map

<h3>PERCENT FEDERAL LANDS</h3>
<p>Farmlands that are owned by the government are known as federal
lands. These federal lands are much easier to purchase than those that
are privately owned. The goal of this project is to get as many
farmlands as possible for the establishment of the Buffalo Commons, as
such, federal lands provide a higher potential for land acquisition than
private farmlands. The percent federal land variable was used to
determine the counties with the highest percent federal lands and those
with the lowest. Counties with the highest percent federal lands were
preferred to those with low percent federal lands and thus were assigned
a suitability rank of 5. Those with the lowest percentage of federal
lands were assigned a suitability rank of 1. The suitability rank ranged
from 1 through to 5, with 5 being the highest suitability rank.</p>
<p>The Natural Breaks classification method was used for this variable.
The lowest classification value was less than 4.8 percent and the
highest was greater than 60.1 percent. The most suitable areas were
represented with the yellow color and the least suitable places were
represented with the red color. Below is the classification table for
the percent federal land variable.</p>

<p>From the map, almost the entire eastern part of the plains has low
percentages of federal land, this is evident with the red color shown on
the map. The few counties with the highest percentage of federal lands
can be found in the states of New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming, and
Montana. The Percent Federal Lands map is shown below.</p>

<h3>COUNTIES ADJACENT TO INDIAN RESERVATIONS</h3>
<p>Counties adjacent to Indian reservations are better for the situation
of Buffalo Commons. In this project, a special query was conducted using
the select by location tool to select counties that are 5 US Survey
Miles from Indian reservations. Here, counties that are adjacent to
Indian reservations were assigned a suitability rank of 1, and those
that are not adjacent to the reservations were assigned a suitability
rank of 0.</p>
<p>The counties that were adjacent to the Indian reservations were
symbolized with a yellow color and those that are not adjacent are in
white. The Indian reservations are symbolized with the pink color. The
method of classification used was the natural breaks. The classification
ranged from 0 to 1, with 1 being counties adjacent to Indian
reservations.</p>

<h3>FINAL SUITABILITY RESULTS</h3>
<p>After all the maps were created with ranks assigned to each variable,
the next step was to create a final suitability layer to determine the
best place to establish the Buffalo Commons. To do this, the attribute
tables for the variables were joined into one table using the FIPS Code
value for each county. After joining all the tables, a final suitability
feature layer was created with two additional fields. The fields were
the final suitability rank field and the total cost of farmland. To
create the final suitability rank field was created by adding the
suitability rank for each variable and then dividing it by 4.2. The
number 4.2 was derived by adding the maximum number of suitability ranks
possible by the number of variables. In this case, the highest possible
suitability number was 21 divided by the number of variables which is
5.</p>
<p>The final suitability rank ranged from 1 through to 5 with 5 being
the highest suitability rank and the lowest suitability rank being 1.
The final suitability layer was classified using the Quantile method
with 5 classes. The highest class was 4.5 representing high suitability
with the lowest being 1.7 indicating low suitability. The most suitable
counties are symbolized with yellow, and the least suitable counties are
symbolized with red. The color symbology ranges from yellow through to
red.</p>

<h3>PROPOSED BUFFALO COMMONS</h3>
<p>Finally, I selected the counties that have high suitability ranking
and farmlands that cost a little bit less than 10 billion USD. My
proposed areas for the Buffalo Commons were in the states of Montana,
New Mexico, Nebraska, and North and South Dakota. The total cost of
farmlands for my proposed locations was $9,928,664,218. A total of 44
counties were selected.</p>
<p>The selection of the counties for the Buffalo Commons was influenced
by several factors such as the presence of interstate highways and
proximity to big cities. Since the Buffalo Commons is a nature
preservation site, it is better to be far from large cities as well as
highways. For this reason, I chose locations that are not too close to
large cities with too many populations. Also, I tried to minimize the
proximity to highways as much possible as it can be. From the map, even
though some highways pass through the Buffalo Commons in the northern
and southern parts, it is the best location possible considering all
available restrictions.</p>
<p>The selected location for the Buffalo Commons is symbolized by the
green color. The highways are shown with brown lines and the big cities
are represented as points with their names marked beside them. The map
of the Proposed Buffalo Commons is shown below.</p>

<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
<p>The need to create nature reserves to protect biodiversity from human
impacts comes with the need to find the best locations to place these
reserves. After the lands in the Great Plains became unsustainable for
commercial farming, due to the various disasters and declining
population, there became a need to use the plains as a nature reserve
for American Bisons. Even though this idea, after it was introduced, did
not receive much attention has now become relevant to policymakers and
thus, there has been a need to find the best location to situate this
Buffalo Commons. This project aims to find the best places within the
Great Plains to locate these buffalo commons.</p>
<p>This project used five variables to determine the best location for
the Buffalo Commons. These variables included Population Density,
Population Change, Farmland Value, Counties Adjacent to Indian Lands,
and Percent Federal Lands. These variables were assigned suitability
ranks, and then analyses were made using ArcGIS Pro.</p>
<p>Based on the above-mentioned variables, a final suitability rank was
developed to determine the best locations for the Buffalo Commons. After
reviewing various conditions that may affect the Buffalo Commons, such
as proximity to large cities and the presence of highways, I selected
counties in four States, which include Montana, North and South Dakota,
and New Mexico.</p>
<p>The Construction of the Buffalo Commons comes at a cost. Considering
the 20 billion USD budget constraints and a need to compensate
landowners by paying them twice the amount of the land, I made sure that
the total cost of the farmlands to be purchased was less than 10 billion
USD. To be precise, the total projected cost of land purchase was
$9,928,664,218. Approximately, 228,519 people would be affected by the
construction of Buffalo Commons.</p>
<p>In Conclusion, this paper has been able to identify the best places
within the Great Plains for the establishment of the Buffalo Commons.
Thus, to look out for a detailed explanation of the best location to
establish the Buffalo Commons and how to identify the best places for
the Commons, the above explains all.</p>
